Driver Management:
I added the "Delete Support Staff" tab.

In the "View and Add Driver Rating(s)" tab, I widened repositioned the driver rating text box so that the text can be viewed better. 

In the "View and Add Driver Rating(s)" tab, I've changed the panel title name to match the tab title. 

Order Management:
I added the "Delete Order" tab.

In the "View Order Details" tab, I got rid of that text box in it since the order details are popping up in another window. The text box was not doing anything, 
so I figure there's no reason to have it since the information pops up in a new window.

Staff Management:
In the "Assign Issue Status" tab, since a new window with a text box pops up for the issue type, there doesn't need to be a text box in the tab window too. 
I think it is better to have one or the other but not both. You can get rid of whichever one you want, and I will update the user guide with your choice.

In the "Update Issue Status" tab, I've updated the label "Select New Status" to "Select New Issue Status" so that its purpose is clearer.

In the "Update Issue Status" tab, I've updated the "Get Current Status" button text to "Get Staff Member's Status"

In the "Update Issue Status" tab, I've updated the "Update Status" button to "Update Issue Status"

Payment Management:
In the "Generate Receipt" tab, I resized the receipt window so that everything is viewable without having to scroll horizontally.
